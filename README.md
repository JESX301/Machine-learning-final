# Machine-learning-final
Html link to jupyter notebook output. This is horrendous, it was my teachers first semester running the course. He made us run it on our personal laptops (on campus labs were offered but the processes literally took consecutive days and I commuted).

Still, it shows I have experience using notebooks, python, and ML libraries. Any data is good data as they say. I actually got an A on this because I understood the limitations and explained them well enough.

To easily view the project, download the project as a zip file and open it in a browser.
